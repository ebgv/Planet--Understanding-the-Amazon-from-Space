# Planet--Understanding-the-Amazon-from-Space
Kaggle Competition consisting in using satellite data to track the human footprint in the Amazon rainforest. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space)

The Powerpoint presentation explains the objective and methodology of this project.

1. Open Colab

## Load the data for weather classification
2. Run the notebook "downloading_from_kaggle.ipynb" to load the data on Colab virtual environment

## Simple Model from scratch 
3. Run the notebook "building_simple_model.ipynb" on Colab, without resetting the virtual environment from 2

## A deeper model
4. Run the notebook "model2_hidden_layers.ipynb" on Colab, without resetting the virtual environment from 2

## Load the data for binary (Road vs Water) classification
5. Run the notebook "binary_downloading_from_kaggle.ipynb" to load the data on Colab virtual environment

## Resnet Model and its Class Activation Maps
6. Run the notebook "building_resnet_model_with_activation.ipynb" on Colab, without resetting the virtual environment from 5
